# PermissionsOne

This is a basic activity based android application. I created this application to learn how to ask user for permission such as camera, phone call etc during application runtime.

I tried to create a helper class that helps me to prompt user for permissions and keep prompting him until he finally allows us. This will be beneficial for absolute required permission which are required for app functionality.

The provided class might be extended by me in future to support optional permission and required permission and You are free to use it as per your use case.
